# Code Wars

 > Your code must change itself in memory to survive.

<cite>&mdash; GitHub Game Off 2013</cite>


## Overview

Players write Programs in RedAsm to battle with other Players' Programs.
Programs must change memory locations to survive and grow.
The last Program standing wins.

The game board is a virtual computer, MARS. 
MARS has a circular memory of 4096 32bit words.
MARS has no registers, only primary memory (RAM).

A Thread that executes an invalid operation dies.


## Gameplay

- All participating players submit their Program to the Referee
- The Referree places each Program into a random place in Memory.
- If a player's Thread encounters an illegal operation it dies.
- When only one player's Threads remain, a winner is declared.
