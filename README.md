# Code Wars

#### Your code must change itself in memory to survive.

<em>A GitHub Game Off 2013 Entry.</em>


## Overview

The game board is a virtual computer, MARS.   
Players write Programs in RedAsm to battle with other Players' Programs.  
Programs must change memory locations to survive and grow.  
MARS has a circular memory of 4096 32bit words.  
MARS has no registers, only primary memory (RAM).  
A Thread that executes an invalid operation dies.


For more details see [NOTES](blob/master/NOTES.md).

## Gameplay

1. All participating players submit their Program to the Referee
1. The Referree places each Program into a random place in Memory.
1. If a player's Thread encounters an illegal operation it dies.
1. When only one player's Threads remain, a winner is declared.
